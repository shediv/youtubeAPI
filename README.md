# shippable

Intro
I have built this project using NodeJS and AngularJS.
Here user will enter a public github url of a branch and he will be able to see all the open issue for a specific branch

How To run Manually:
1. clone it from git using "git clone https://github.com/shediv/shippable.git"
2. run "sudo npm install"
3. run "npm install octonode"
4. finally run your code via "node index.js"
